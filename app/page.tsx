                with a concentration in Systems/Architecture and Information
                Internetworks. I have a passion for software engineering,
                computer networking, and education, with hands-on experience
                from internships at Palantir, Pery, and Thetaray.

                As a teaching assistant for Computer Networks and a former Head
                TA for Computer Architecture, I enjoy making complex technical
                concepts accessible.
